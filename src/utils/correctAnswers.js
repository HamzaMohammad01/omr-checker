RTGs are crucial for missions where solar power is impractical, such as deep space exploration, due to their longevity and durability in harsh environments.</p> <p><strong>Statement 1 is incorrect.</strong> RTGs are not miniature fission reactors.

The most spectacular and evolutionarily fascinating examples of mutualism are found in plant-animal relationships. Plants need the help of animals to pollinate their flowers and disperse their seeds.</p> <p><strong>Figs and wasps depend on each other to reproduce, and this is a fantastic example of co-evolution.</strong> In many species of fig trees, <strong>there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator species of wasp. It means that a given fig species can be pollinated only by its &#8216;partner&#8217; wasp species and no other species</strong>. The female wasp uses the fruit not only as an oviposition (egg-laying) site but uses the developing seeds within the fruit for nourishing its larvae. The wasp pollinates the fig inflorescence while searching for suitable egg-laying sites. In return for the favour of pollination, the fig offers the wasp some of its developing seeds, as food for the developing wasp larvae.</p> <p><strong>Source:</strong> NCERT Class 12<sup>th</sup> Biology Page 237</p> ",

Consider that the isolation received at the top of the atmosphere is 100 per cent. While passing through the atmosphere some amount of energy is reflected, scattered and absorbed. Only the remaining part reaches the earth&#8217;s surface. Roughly 35 units are reflected back to space even before reaching the earth’s surface. Of these, 27 units are reflected back from the top of the clouds and 2 units from the snow and ice-covered areas of the earth. The reflected amount of radiation is called the albedo of the earth.</p> <p>The remaining 65 units are absorbed, 14 units within the atmosphere and 51 units by the earth’s surface. The earth radiates back 51 units in the form of terrestrial radiation. Of these, 17 units are radiated to space directly and the remaining 34 units are absorbed by the atmosphere. <strong>Thus, the atmosphere is heated more by terrestrial radiation than by incoming solar radiation.</strong></p> <p><strong>Statement II is correct</strong>.

The thickness of the troposphere varies with latitude. It is thickest at the equator and thinnest at the poles. This variation is due to the differences in temperature and, consequently, the density of the air at different latitudes. Warm air is less dense and causes the troposphere to expand, making it thicker at the equator.</p> <p><strong>Statement II is correct.</strong> At the equator, the intense solar heating causes strong convectional currents. These currents transport heat to great heights, contributing to the greater thickness of the troposphere in this region.</p> <p><strong>Statement II is the correct explanation for Statement I</strong>.

RTGs are crucial for missions where solar power is impractical, such as deep space exploration, due to their longevity and durability in harsh environments.</p> <p><strong>Statement 1 is incorrect.</strong> RTGs are not miniature fission reactors.

The most spectacular and evolutionarily fascinating examples of mutualism are found in plant-animal relationships. Plants need the help of animals to pollinate their flowers and disperse their seeds.</p> <p><strong>Figs and wasps depend on each other to reproduce, and this is a fantastic example of co-evolution.</strong> In many species of fig trees, <strong>there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator species of wasp. It means that a given fig species can be pollinated only by its &#8216;partner&#8217; wasp species and no other species</strong>. The female wasp uses the fruit not only as an oviposition (egg-laying) site but uses the developing seeds within the fruit for nourishing its larvae. The wasp pollinates the fig inflorescence while searching for suitable egg-laying sites. In return for the favour of pollination, the fig offers the wasp some of its developing seeds, as food for the developing wasp larvae.</p> <p><strong>Source:</strong> NCERT Class 12<sup>th</sup> Biology Page 237</p> ",

Consider that the isolation received at the top of the atmosphere is 100 per cent. While passing through the atmosphere some amount of energy is reflected, scattered and absorbed. Only the remaining part reaches the earth&#8217;s surface. Roughly 35 units are reflected back to space even before reaching the earth’s surface. Of these, 27 units are reflected back from the top of the clouds and 2 units from the snow and ice-covered areas of the earth. The reflected amount of radiation is called the albedo of the earth.</p> <p>The remaining 65 units are absorbed, 14 units within the atmosphere and 51 units by the earth’s surface. The earth radiates back 51 units in the form of terrestrial radiation. Of these, 17 units are radiated to space directly and the remaining 34 units are absorbed by the atmosphere. <strong>Thus, the atmosphere is heated more by terrestrial radiation than by incoming solar radiation.</strong></p> <p><strong>Statement II is correct</strong>.

The thickness of the troposphere varies with latitude. It is thickest at the equator and thinnest at the poles. This variation is due to the differences in temperature and, consequently, the density of the air at different latitudes. Warm air is less dense and causes the troposphere to expand, making it thicker at the equator.</p> <p><strong>Statement II is correct.</strong> At the equator, the intense solar heating causes strong convectional currents.
